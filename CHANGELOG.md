- Mass-Message sender, can send your message to the users by counting backwards
 from the given id number. It's currently in beta stage and needs some
  performance improvements. (<https://ibb.co/mb7tOA>)
- Under the "supervisors" page, you will some changes on the couple of elements
 (<https://ibb.co/htzafq>). Like filtering the users by selecting a rank or
  ranks in the ranks list. And also you can send a message to all moderators or
 listed moderators on this page.
 <https://brainly.co.id/moderators/supervisors/1> (You need to change the
 link for your market's domain name)

- Some of the language files are not translated by me so from now on these
 contributors nicks will be visible along with language names in the
 language options (<https://ibb.co/mKO5Vq>)

### Changed

- Finding a user by id on the moderation panel is now able to search using with
 nick and id (<https://ibb.co/f3i7BV>)
- Under the "User content view > responses" page, extension changes the
 layout for quick review. But shows you an attachment icon for who has added a
 attachment in to their response. This feature makes some confusion about who
 added this attachment, so in this update you can see only the related user
 answer attachment icon only. There is no need to show an icon for other user's attachments.
- Normal users can't able to click this
 (<http://i.imgur.com/fRwLKqr.png>) text before, now its clickable.
 (Normal user's that don't have any special privilige in the extension can also
 use the extension with access permission with out being a moderator. This will
 not be any security risks for Brainly and users questions/answers/comments at
 all, because they don't have moderator privilege to make actions.)
- Under the "User content view" page, if listed contents are already deleted or
 approved by another user while extension user starts to delete or approve the
 content, extension will inform you about this and pass this process without
 being stucked.
- Under the "Archive Mod" page, the question delete buttons color is now orange
 #FBC02D (<https://ibb.co/eMLCAq>)
- The quick delete buttons labels are now visible on the mobile view when the
 user tries to touch it
- There is an issue with the extend message page layout checkbox in the
 extension options that thecheckbox didn't show the current status.
- The unfriend all and unfriend buttons are has been hidden from the
 other users profile <https://ibb.co/fiNyrV>
