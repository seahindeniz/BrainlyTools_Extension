If you have any questions or suggestions, please create a new issue. I'd be
happy to hear your thoughts.


### Attention please :warning:

Feature requests or issues can be written in different languages other than
English. Because we have lots of users from many countries that can't speak
English well enough. So it's best to have no restriction about languages. Our
only concern is that how do you use your language and that's it. If you like to
post anything, please choose your words carefully and create elegant and smooth
sentences in your language and try to explain as much as you can so that we can
understand by translating your words via Google Translate.

Thanks in advance!
