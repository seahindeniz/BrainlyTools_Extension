  once.
- Mass-Message sender, can send your message to the users by counting backwards
 from the given id number. It's currently in beta stage and needs some
  performance improvements. (<https://ibb.co/mb7tOA>)

 (<https://ibb.co/htzafq>). Like filtering the users by selecting a rank or
  ranks in the ranks list. And also you can send a message to all moderators or
 listed moderators on this page.
 <https://brainly.co.id/moderators/supervisors/1> (You need to change the
 link for your market's domain name)

### Changed

 nick and id (<https://ibb.co/f3i7BV>)

 layout for quick review. But shows you an attachment icon for who has added a
 attachment in to their response. This feature makes some confusion about who
 added this attachment, so in this update you can see only the related user
 answer attachment icon only. There is no need to show an icon for other user's
 attachments.

 [this](http://i.imgur.com/fRwLKqr.png) text before to switch the reported
 content between question&answer and comments, now its clickable. (Btw.
 moderator or non-moderator user's who has not any special privilige in the
 extension can also use the extension with just access permission can be given
 by the extension manager. This will not be any security risks for Brainly and
 moderating system at all, because they don't have privilege to make actions.)
- Under the "User content view" page, if listed contents are already deleted or
 approved by another user while extension user starts to delete or approve the
 content, extension will inform you about this and pass this process without
 being stucked.
